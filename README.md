WordPress Plugin Template
=========================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/wpugph/plugin-generator-full.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/wpugph/plugin-generator-full)

A robust and GPL-licensed code template for creating a standards-compliant WordPress plugin. Forked from https://github.com/hlashbrooke/WordPress-Plugin-Template to suit my personal requirements when creating WP customizations.

A good way to get started in building your plugins via the command line.
